# Cplusplus-Program.

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  The corner Grocer App Is uses to input data from a file and the frequency that an item appears then allows the user to either search a specific item or show all items in the form of a numerical value or a histogram. Afterwords outputs those frequencies to a output file.
  
What did you do particularly well?
  Figuring out how to input the items from a file and set the frequency was very easy for me. I did come up with some hicups when using maps with a private data in the class but I believe it all turned out really well.
  
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  I rushed when i approached the histogram portion of the project and ended up just copy pasting from the numerical portion which lead me to lose some points due to it not being structured well. Otherwise with my current skill set I believe i wrote this code the to the best of my ability.
  
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
  As i previously stated I found some issues with using maps with a private member in the class and I also seem to always have issues with passing objects by refrence but with the help of my professor and rereading zybooks a million times I was able to come up with a solution that made the code work how I wanted it to.
  
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  Learning C++ will be very useful as many jobs would like you to know it but specifically the deeper understanding of OOP princibles I think will be invaluable moving foward as those are a huge portation of writing code that I had otherwise been laking 
  
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  The use of the class and the map makes this very maintainable and adaptable because if say I needed a new file to be read I could do so with ease while also keeping the original files data. I also had used multiple cpp files to separate my code to make it more readable.
